# Faster implementation of area_crossing_range for Orbits::Orbit
#
# Instead of "densifying" points using GeometryToCoordinatesConverter
# and backtracking each point individuall, this algorithm deals with
# pairs of points.  It identifies segments which will have a continuous
# range of backtracked longitudes, backtracks the endpoints of the
# segments, and produces a continous ranged between the backtracking
# results.
#
# With the old algorithm, finding the area crossing for a bounding box
# edge spanning 180 degrees and a 2km swath width orbit required
# about 10,000 iterations of the backtracking algorithm, taking multiple
# seconds.  The new algorithm finds the area crossing for such a
# segment with 2 backtracking iterations and finishes in under a millisecond.
#
# Note: This module is very tightly coupled with Orbits::Orbit.  It
# is not meant to exist separately.  It is here to avoid detracting from the
# core backtracking algorithm's readability.  This code is much uglier and
# has to deal with more edge cases (heh, edge cases).

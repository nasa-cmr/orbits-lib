# This is a Ruby implementation of the Backtrack Orbit Search Algorithm (BOSA)
# originally written in Java and maintained by [NSIDC](http://nsidc.org/).
# References to "the Java code" or "the NSIDC spheres code" in the refer
# to the original library which is available
# [here](http://geospatialmethods.org/spheres/).  Along with the original
# code, geospatialmethods.org also has a [description of the algorithm]
# (http://geospatialmethods.org/bosa/).
#
#### Overview
#
# Orbiting satellites have sensors that trace a circular path around the
# Earth.  It is difficult to express this ground track as a 2D polygon
# with lat/lon coordinates.  Most of the orbits we deal with have a
# long, narrow, sinusoidal shape that would require hundreds of points
# to describe.  Further, their minimum bounding rectangle covers nearly
# the whole Earth and some orbits have ground tracks that cross themselves
# within a single granule of data.
#
# Instead of describing the orbit as a complex 2D polygon, we want to
# answer a different question:
#
# *Where would the orbit need to cross the equator in order to see
# a given point on the Earth?*
#
# Instead of using a complicated 2D polygon query, we could instead perform
# a simple range query: "Find all data granules whose orbit crosses the
# equator between longitudes `a` and `b`."
#
# This class contains the methods used to determine the equator crossing range
# for a given orbit and point on the Earth.
#
# If we want to find data which intersects a more complicated area of the
# Earth, we can decompose that area into points and perform a similar range
# query.  We add points along the perimiter of the shape so that any orbit
# that intersects the shape will pass over points on the perimiter.  This
# process of adding points is called *densification*.
#
#### Conventions
#
# Where readability allows, we suffix variables with their units
#
#   * _rad = radians (Earth radii)
#   * _deg = degrees
#   * _m = meters
#   * _s = seconds
#
# We use some default units where no suffix is present:
#
#   * latitude and longitude: degrees
#   * other angles and distances: radians (Earth radii)
#   * time: seconds
#
# phi (`phi`) and theta (`theta`) are used to denote the radian counterparts
# of latitude and longitude respectively, since the latter are almost always
# expressed in degrees.
#
#### Definitions
#
#   * **inclination**: Angle of the orbit from the equator.  Numbers greater
#       than 90 degrees are common and indicate a retrograde orbit
#   * **prograde orbit**: An orbit that travels in the direction of the
#       Earth's rotation
#   * **retrograde orbit**: An orbit that travels in the direction opposite
#       the Earth's rotation
#   * **inflection point**: A point where the orbit reaches its highest
#       or lowest latitude
#   * **declination**: The angle between the orbits inflection points and the
#       nearest pole.  Note that this definition is similar to magnetic
#       compass declination.  Celestial declination is a different concept.
#   * **nadir**: The opposite of zenith - a vector pointing straight down at a
#       given point.

    ##### coord_crossing_range
    #
    # This method performs the Backtrack Orbit Search Algorithm.
    #
    # Given a coordinate, returns a range of longitudes.  Orbital passes
    # which cross the equator within the returned range will cover the
    # given coordinate with their swath.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # * **coord** - The coordinate whose equator crossing range we're
    #   interested in (Orbit::Coordinate)
    # * **ascending** - A boolean value.  If true, we return ranges
    #   where the orbit crosses the equator on its ascending pass.  If
    #   false, we return ranges where the orbit crosses the equator on
    #   its descending pass.
    #
    # Returns an Orbit::LongitudeCoverage

      # If the point is above the full coverage `phi`, it's covered by every pass
      return LongitudeCoverage.full if coord.phi.abs > full_coverage_phi

      # We start by figuring out how wide the swath is at the coordinate,
      # along the longitude lines.  This is different from the orbit's
      # swath width parameter, because the measurement runs parallel to
      # the equator, not perpendicular to the orbit.
      west_edge, east_edge = *horizontal_swath_edges(coord, ascending)

      # If the swath has no edges at the coordinate, there's no coverage
      return LongitudeCoverage.none if west_edge.nil? || east_edge.nil?

      # TODO one edge may pass over the equator before the other, and the
      #      Earth will rotate in the mean time, which will skew the
      #      longitude range slightly.  The NSIDC site mentions this, but
      #      the Java code doesn't account for it.

      # This part is a little tricky.  The swath area to the west of the point
      # is covered by a range of orbits to the east of the point, so we use
      # the west swath edge to calculate the range of orbits crossing to the
      # east and vice versa.

    ##### horizontal_swath_edges
    #
    # Given coord, a coordinate within the orbital swath, returns an array
    # of 2 points with the same latitude as coord which lie on the swath edges.
    # The first point lies on the edge to the west of coord, the second to the
    # east.
    #
    # If the coordinate cannot fall within the swath, returns an empty array
    #
    # Parameters:
    # * **coord** - A coordinate (Orbit::Coordinate) within the swath
    # * **ascending** - A boolean value.  If true, we return edges for the
    #   orbit's ascending pass.  If false, we return edges for the descending
    #   pass.

    # Returns an array containing 0 or 2 Orbit::Coordinate instances

      # Before returning, we'll take the two points closest to the given
      # coordinate
      candidates = []

      # We need to be able to assume the coordinate isn't on the equator, so
      # we'll return early if we find that it is.  We know the swath width
      # from the orbit parameters.  This calculation is slightly off, since
      # the swath width is measured perpendicular to the orbit, but the
      # Java code makes this assumption.  This case should almost never
      # happen.  When it does, the numbers are likely close enough.
      if coord.phi == 0
        return [Coordinate.phi_theta(0, coord.theta - swath_width_rad / 2),
                Coordinate.phi_theta(0, coord.theta + swath_width_rad / 2)]
      end

      # We ignore the rotation of the Earth for the purposes of this method.
      # The values we return (the swath edges) are not influenced by the
      # Earth's rotation.  Intermediate values are, but they're not visible
      # outside of this method.
      #
      # Ignoring the rotation of the Earth, we can imagine three circles
      # traced by the orbit.  The first is the path on the ground directly
      # beneath the orbit.  This is a great circle whose center is the origin.
      # The other two are the paths traced by the swath edges, which are not
      # great circles and not centered at the origin.
      #
      # These three circles each lie in a plane, and the three planes are
      # parallel to each other.
      #
      # There's another circle we're interested in, which is the circle
      # traced by the latitude line at coord.  This circle lies in its own
      # plane which is not parallel to the other three.
      #
      # The four original circles are the intersections of their respective
      # planes and the sphere of the Earth.
      #
      # So, to find the swath's edge coordinates, we need to find the
      # intersection between three things:
      #
      #   1. `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1`
      #
      #      The sphere of the Earth.  We've scaled everything so the Earth
      #      has radius 1, and it's centered on the origin.  Convenient.
      #
      #   2. `ax + by + cz = d`
      #
      #      The swath's plane.  `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are constants which
      #      we'll calculate.  Since they're parallel, the swath edges share
      #      `a`, `b`, and `c` with the orbital plane, but each edge has a
      #      different `d` value.
      #
      #   3. `z = "coord.z"`
      #
      #      The plane slicing through latitude = coord.lat

      # We already know z

      z = coord.z

      # We'll find `a`, `b`, and `c` for the orbit's plane, which are the same
      # constants for the swath's plane.  To find them, we need 3 non-colinear
      # points in the orbit's plane.  The origin is one, but we need two more.

      # First, we'll get a point that the orbit can pass over which is close
      # to coord.  Usually we'll just use coord, but if coord's latitude is
      # above the orbit's inflection point, we need to find a point with a
      # lower latitude

      target_phi = coord.phi
      target_phi = max_orbit_phi if target_phi > max_orbit_phi
      target_phi = min_orbit_phi if target_phi < min_orbit_phi
      target = Coordinate.phi_theta(target_phi, coord.theta)

      # For the second point, we'll use the equatorial crossing of the orbit
      # through the target.  This is safe, because we bailed earlier if
      # the target was on the equator.  The "false" parameter tells the method
      # to ignore the Earth's rotation.

      cross = equator_crossing(target, ascending, false)

      # For a plane passing through the origin, `ax + by + cz = 0`.  With our
      # two other points, we can solve for `a`, `b`, and `c`:

      a = target.y * cross.z - target.z * cross.y
      b = target.z * cross.x - target.x * cross.z
      c = target.x * cross.y - target.y * cross.x

      # If we can find a point on the swath edge, we can calculate `d`.  We
      # can find a point on each edge by finding the orbit's inflection point
      # and adding/subtracting half the swath width from its latitude.

        # Calculate `d` from the plane equation

        d = a * p.x + b * p.y + c * p.z

        # The fact that `z` is constant is very handy.  It means we really only
        # care about two dimensions.  We're really trying to find the intersection
        # of a line (the edge's plane when `z = "coord.z"`) and a circle (the part
        # of the Earth intersecting `z = "coord.z"`).
        #
        # Note: that simplified math could make it easier to switch this
        # algorithm to use an ellipsoidal Earth (WGS84) in the future, since we
        # would just be intersecting a line with a slightly different circle.
        #

        #
        # `y = -a/b x + (d - cz) / b`
        #
        # Which is the line we need to intersect with the latitude circle.

          # Ok, another problem.  It's possible that both `a` and `b` are 0.  In that
          # case, we have an orbit that follows the equator.  If coord lies within the
          # swath, then every orbit will cover the point, otherwise no orbits will.

          #
          # (We won't use the standard `b` as the `y`-intercept name, since
          # it means something different in the plane equation).

          # We need to find the intersection of that line with the latitude
          # circle at `z = "coord.z"`.  Using the sphere equation with a
          # constant z, we get the latitude circle's equation:
          #
          #  `x^2 + y^2 = 1 - z^2`

          # It's centered at the origin.  `1 - z^2` is the radius squared.
          #

          # lat/lon coordinate.  Further, a negative radius doesn't make sense.

          # `x^2 + m^2x^2 + 2mkx + k^2 = r^2`

          # Grouping constants, we get:

      #
      # [This image](http://geospatialmethods.org/bosa/triangles.gif)
      # is also helpful.  (`Lat_p`, `Lon_p`) is what we call `C`.
      # `(0, Lon_p)` is what we call `B`.  `(0, Lon_n)` is
      # what we call `A`.
      #
      # In order to figure out the crossing point, we need to
      # set up a spherical triangle formed by:
      #
      # point `C` - the given coordinate
      # point `B` - the point at (0, coord.theta)
      # point `A` - the (unknown) point where the orbit crosses the equator
      #
      # To remain consistent with the Wolfram and similar
      # references, we'll use A, B, and C notation.  "`A`" will
      # denote the angle at point `A`.  "`a`" will denote the arc-length
      # of the side across from point `A`.  Our capital variable names will
      # use underscores to remain valid in Ruby, e.g. "_A_"
      #
      # We know two angles:

      # Because side `A` is on a latitude line and side `c` is on
      # the equator

      _B_ = PI / 2

      # `A` is an angle between the orbit and the equator, which
      # is the inclination if it's a retrograde orbit in the
      # descending pass or a prograde orbit in the ascending
      # pass.  Otherwise it's the complement of the inclination

      if retrograde? != ascending
        _A_ = inclination_rad
      else
        _A_ = PI - inclination_rad
      end

      # We also know one side's arc length:

      a = coord.phi

      # Coord could lie above or below the orbit.  We find the nearest
      # inflection point in that case.
      a = max_orbit_phi if a > max_orbit_phi
      a = min_orbit_phi if a < min_orbit_phi

      # We need to find:
      #
      # 1. `c`, which we can add to coord's longitude to find
      #     the crossing longitude
      # 2. `b`, which is the arc length traveled since crossing the
      #     equator.  We can use this to calculate the amount
      #     the Earth has rotated since the satellite crossed
      #     the equator and correct accordingly.

      # Since we know `A`, `a`, and `B`, we can use the law of sines
      # to calculate `b`
      #
      # `sin(A) / sin(a) = sin(B) / sin(b) = sin(\C) / sin(c)`

      sin_b = sin(_B_) * sin(a) / sin(_A_)
      b = asin(sin_b)

      # Finding `c` is trickier because we don't know `C`.  We use [Napier's
      # first analogy](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NapiersAnalogies.html):
      #
      # `sin((A - B)/2) / sin((A + B)/2) = tan((a - b)/2) / tan(c/2)`
      #
      # Rearranging:
      #
      # `tan(c/2) = (tan((a - b)/2) * sin((A + B)/2)) / sin((A - B)/2)`
      #
      # Since `sin((A - B)/2)` could be 0, we'll need to use atan2 and
      # keep the numerator and denominator separate

      numerator = tan((a - b) / 2) * sin(( _A_ + _B_ ) / 2)
      denominator = sin((_A_ - _B_) / 2)

      c = 2 * atan2(numerator, denominator)

      # We now know where the orbit crosses
      crossing_theta = coord.theta + c

      # For the descending pass, we ended up calculating the point half
      # way around the globe, so we need to correct
      crossing_theta -= PI unless ascending

      # Correct for the rotation of the Earth, if necessary
      if corrected
        # Recall, `b` is the angle of the orbit travelled since
        # crossing the equator on the ascending pass (in radians).
        # We can use this to calculate the angular distance covered
        # by the orbit on the requested pass.

        if ascending
          distance_rad = b
        else
          distance_rad = PI - b
        end

        # If the distance is below the starting latitude, the orbit will
        # need to make an additional pass before reaching the target point,
        # so we add `2pi` to the distance.
        distance_rad += 2 * PI while distance_rad < start_clat_rad
        distance_rad -= 2 * PI while distance_rad > start_clat_rad + 2 * PI

        # `"time" = "distance" / "rate"`
        #
        # We know distance from above and rate is given by the orbit parameters,
        # so we can calculate the time since crossing the equator.

        time_since_crossing_s = distance_rad / angular_velocity_rad_s

        # Now we want to know how far the Earth has rotated since we crossed
        # the equator.  We know the Earth's rotation rate and the elapsed time

        earth_rotation_rad = EARTH_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_RAD_S * time_since_crossing_s

        # Since we're working with a unit sphere, we can make the
        # correction directly

        crossing_theta += earth_rotation_rad
